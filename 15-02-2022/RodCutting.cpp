	Problem statement#
	You are given a rod of size n > 1, it can be cut into any number of pieces k. 
	The price for each piece of size i is represented as price(i) 
	and the maximum revenue from a rod of size i is r(i) 
	(could be split into multiple pieces). 
	
	Find r(n){total maximum revenue} for the rod of size n.
